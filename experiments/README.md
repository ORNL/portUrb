# Example experiment directories

You can create your own repositories that mirror the subdirectories of this directory to create and maintain your own experiments apart from the main portUrb repository.
* `experiments`: These are example experiments that demonstrate how to create an experiment from the various portUrb modules, read input files, and create output files using `Coupler` routines.
   * Please see the `experiments/README.md` file for more information regarding what typically goes into creating an experiment source file of your own.
* `unit`: These are being used for internal unit testing of various portUrb modules to track when changes occur and identify potential bugs that may be introduced after the fact. These are really integration tests, not unit tests.
